## Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches faqs from a JSON file, allowing for easy updates without modifying the HTML.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays questions and answers dynamically, enhancing user engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes for a better user experience on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the webpage, providing a clear layout for the faq section.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage, including colors, fonts, and layout to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for fetching the faq data from the JSON file and updating the DOM to display the information.
- **JSON**: Format used to store the faq data, making it easy to read and modify.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/faq-chatbot.git
     ```
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change your directory to the project folder using the command:
     ```bash
     cd faq-chatbot
     ```

3. **Open the Project**:
   - You can open the `faq.html` file directly in your web browser by double-clicking it, or you can use a local server to serve the files (recommended for AJAX requests).
   - If you prefer using a local server, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
     - For Python 3:
       ```bash
       python -m http.server
       ```
     - This command will start a server at `http://localhost:8000/`. You can then open your web browser and go to this address to view the project.

## Usage

1. **Opening the Webpage**:
   - If you opened the `index.html` file directly, the page will load in your web browser displaying "Frequently Asked Questions."

2. **Interacting with the faq**:
   - The page will automatically fetch the questions and answers from the provided JSON file (`faqs.json`) and display them under the title.

3. **Check the JSON File**:
   - Ensure that the `faqs.json` file is in the same directory as the `index.html` file, or update the path in your JavaScript code if it is located elsewhere.

## Libraries

The following libraries were used in the development of this project:

### For Natural Language Processing (NLP)
